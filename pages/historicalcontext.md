## About the Collection
This site presents a collection which contains digitized photographs and documents from the papers of folklorist Warren E. Roberts (1924-1999)at the Indiana University Archives. The items collected here consist of a selection of documented vernacular architecture buidlings throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Not all such items from within the collection have been included, for the sake of creating a managable collection. The backs of the photographs within the collection have also been included when they offer contextual information about what is depicated in the photograph. 

The finding aid for the collection can be found here: [Indiana University Archive](https://archives.iu.edu/html/InU-Ar-VAA9415.html)
