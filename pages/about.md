## About the Collection
This site presents a collection which contains digitized photographs and documents from the papers of folklorist Warren E. Roberts (1924-1999)at the Indiana University Archives. The items collected here consist of a selection of documented vernacular architecture buidlings throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Not all such items from within the collection have been included, for the sake of creating a managable collection. The backs of the photographs within the collection have also been included when they offer contextual information about what is depicated in the photograph. 

The finding aid for the collection can be found here: [Indiana University Archive](https://archives.iu.edu/html/InU-Ar-VAA9415.html)

## About the Technical Standards
The work in this site followed a variety of technical standards. For the representation of dates and geographic coordinates, ISO standard formatting was used. All materials were scanned on an archival quality flatbed Epson Scanner. The metadata fields used to described the materials are pulled from the required CollectionBuilder fields, Dublin Core standards, and customized fields in order to appropriately describe the materials and to provide the appropriate archival citation. 
The metadata was largely pulled directly from the archival descriptions and the contextual information within the materials themselves. The primary exception is the architectural terms, which I used standardized terms from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/).

## Aboout the People
This site is created by Alex Caba. As of creating this site, she is at Indiana University getting her Masters in Library Science, with a concentration in Rare Books and Manuscripts. This collection was created as part of the course Z652 Digital Libraries, taught by John Walsh with Assistant Instructor Alex Wingate. 

The creation of this site would also not have been possible without the assistance of Indiana University Archives, in particuarly Katherine Morrison.
